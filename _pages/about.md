`Welcome to my homepage!`

I’m Zehua Wang, currently 24 years old and a third-year master's student in pharmacokinetics at China Pharmaceutical University, expected to graduate in 2025. Before this, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Pharmaceutical Engineering from Shandong First Medical University.    
My research focuses on the pharmacometrics of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) and Alzheimer’s disease treatments. I’m proficient in data modeling and analysis software like Monolix, NONMEM, Winnonlin, R, and PK-sim, with a strong passion for advancing the development of new drugs, particularly large molecule antibodies, and improving the clinical application of existing therapies.    
I love collaboration and communication, and I've been involved in various joint projects, such as working with Professor Nick Holford and Dr. Jacqueline Hannam’s team at the University of Auckland on pharmacometric studies of Alzheimer’s disease antibody therapies. I’ve also led a team working with industry partners on the development of new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and adjusting clinical treatment strategies.    
In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, cooking, and playing games—whether it’s traditional board games or video games. When I have more free time, I love traveling, photography, and video editing (I even independently produced two graduation films during my undergrad years, and some of my work won national awards). If you share any of these interests, I’d love to chat and share experiences!    
I’m passionate about the world and believe that the meaning of life lies in exploring things we haven’t experienced before. If, in the process, I can help advance society and bring happiness to people, all the better—that's why I love research. Through my work, I aim to contribute to new drug development and personalized medicine, ultimately benefiting more patients.
