`Welcome to my homepage!`

I am Zehua Wang (Zack Wang), a 25-year-old recent graduate with a Masterâ€™s degree in Pharmacokinetics from China Pharmaceutical University. This October, I will commence my PhD in Pharmacology at the University of Auckland.
My research interests lie in pharmacometrics and clinical pharmacology. I possess expertise in various data modeling and analysis software, including Monolix, NONMEM, Phoenix WinNonlin, R, and PK-Sim. I am particularly passionate about advancing the development of new drugs and improving their clinical applications.  
Outside my academic pursuits, I enjoy swimming, cooking, and playing both traditional board games and video games. I also have a keen interest in traveling, photography, and video editing. During my undergraduate studies, I independently produced two graduation films and several personal short films, which received national recognition. I love collaboration and open communication; if you share similar interests, I would be delighted to connect and exchange experiences.
For me, life is a thrilling exploration, and I'm excited to make a difference through my research in drug development and personalized medicine. I believe that the pursuit of knowledge has significant societal value, and my goal is to improve healthcare outcomes for patients.
